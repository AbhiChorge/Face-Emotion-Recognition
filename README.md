# Face-Emotion-Recognition
This is my BE Project Face Emotion Recognition.
Facial Expression is one of the best ways to express emotional states. One of the current application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) using neural networks is the recognition of faces in image for various application.
In this project, I presented a method for identifying seven emotions such as Anger, Disgust, Neutral, Fear, Happy, Sad and Surprise using facial images.
In this project, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used, CNN contains few layers which helps to identify the emotion of faces in image. It can also detect multiple faces.
And also used Facial Emotion Recognition 2013 (FER-2013) Dataset for validation and training.
Facial Emotion Recognition can be used for surveillance purposes by law enforces as well as in crowd management.
